# Parkinson’s Disease Detection

This project aims to detect Parkinson's disease using a computer vision approach. It leverages **transfer learning** with a pre-trained **Inception V4** model for feature extraction and employs **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification. The primary goal is to classify individuals as either healthy or affected by Parkinson's disease based on visual data.
